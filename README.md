# Feed Reader Testing (using Jasmine)

## About
* This is my initial submission for Project #4 for the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. 
* The starter code provided by Udacity to all students can be accessed [here](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader).
* This project demonstrates browrser-based testing using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/).
* Students were given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds  an incomplete test suite, and were asked to use Jasmine to write a number of tests suites, following the development strategy described bellow. 

# Development Strategy

1. Familiarize yourself with the starter code
    * Open up `index.html` and review the functionality of the application within your browser
    * What is all the code in `app.js` doing? Be sure to read all code comments
    * Check out `style.css`. How is styling applied to the application?
2. Explore the Jasmine spec file in `feedreader.js`
    * This is the file in which you'll be writing your tests
    * Make sure to read all code comments here as well
    * Review the [Jasmine documentation](http://jasmine.github.io) if needed
3. Edit the `allFeeds` variable in `app.js` to make the provided test fail
    * See how Jasmine visualizes this failure in your application
    * Return the `allFeeds` variable to a passing state after reviewing the failed test
4. Write a test that loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a URL defined _and_ that the URL is not empty
    * For example, how would you use a `for...of` loop in this test?
5. Write a test that loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty
    * Think about how you wrote the previous test. What are you testing for this time?
6. Write a new test suite named `"The menu"`
    * What are you `describe`-ing in this test suite?
7. Write a test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default
    * You'll have to analyze the HTML and the CSS to determine how the hiding/showing of the menu element is implemented
    * What code in `app.js` is directly involved with toggling the menu on and off?
8. Write a test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked. This test should have two expectations: does the menu display itself when clicked, and does it hide when clicked again?
    * Think about how you wrote the previous test. What is different this time around?
    * Which clickable element are you checking for?
    * How do you "simulate" a mouse click that element without actually clicking it?
9. Write a test suite named `"Initial Entries"`
    * What are you `describe`-ing in this test suite?
10. Write a test that ensures when the `loadFeed` function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single `.entry` element within the `.feed` container
    * How does Jasmine's `beforeEach()`function work?
    * How does the `loadFeed()` function in `app.js` work? Is it synchronous or asynchronous?
11. Write a test suite named `"New Feed Selection"`
    * What are you `describe`-ing in this test suite?
12. Write a test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the `loadFeed` function that the content actually changes
    * How is this test different from the previous test?

Additionally, note that:

 * No test should be dependent on the results of another
 * Callbacks should be used to ensure that feeds are loaded before they are tested
 * Error handling should be implemented for undefined variables and out-of-bound array access
 * When complete, all of your tests should pass

When you're all finished, write a `README` file detailing all steps required to successfully run the application. If you have added additional tests, provide documentation for what these future features are and what the tests are checking for.

## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development." This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!

## How to run

1. If you want to run the Application locally (on your machine):
* Download or clone the repository
* Open index.html file in your browser

2. You can preview the ready project with complete test suites on  its [github page](https://curiouscc.github.io/P4-Feedreader-testing)
* The test results will appear on the bottom of the page, below the Feed Reader.
